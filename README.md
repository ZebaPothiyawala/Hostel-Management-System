HMS is supposed to have the following features:
          handle the resources of admin, warden, and inmate.

The hostel booking system is developed in favour of the hostel management team which helps then to save the records of the students about their rooms and other things it helps them for the manual work from which it is very difficult to find the record of the students and the information about those ones who had left the hostel years before.
